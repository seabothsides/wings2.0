    - One of the services we provide here at wings is supported live in care. We understand that in order for an individual to attain and maintain independent living a support network is paramount. At wings our support workers give individuals the help and care they need to be comfortable in their own home. Family members have much more freedom in when they want to visit and our staff will never be in the way, but will always be there for professional and fast help
    - you wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.
    - We understand that finding the right staff in any situation is difficult. We aim to only recruit members who meet all the top criteria of a brilliant staff member, and are up to date with modern standards. As well as DBS checked and vetted. We provide trained and experienced nurses and carers for care homes. We can cater to short and long term work requirements with high proficiency.
    - Cleaners are amazing here
